# Foreword

# Business Specifications
Spring Roll is a fresh, energetic company. Company management rule base on two major aspects
## Department Management
Company has _departments_ (e.g: Customer Service, Development, Human Resources..). Each _department_ is lead by a _manager_ and many _employees_. The _manager_ and _employees_ in a department all have contracts with _time period_, that means they only work for a period of time in a department. Working contract timeline start and end with specific days.

A department can only have **only one** manager at a period of time.

One employee can have working contracts with departments. But **they must not have a concurrent working contract at a same period time with multiple departments** (e.g: A can not have a working contract from _03/2017_ to _06/2017_ in Human Resources Dept and a working contract from _05/2017_ to _08/2017_ with another dept.). They cannot be the manager of a department which they are not currently has a contract with. (e.g A currently has an active contract with H.R Dept, so he can't be the manager of Development Dept).

## Employee Management
An employee as described above, has _working contract_ with departments in company.
